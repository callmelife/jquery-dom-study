# jQuery Study

## Required Readings

-   [The DOM | Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model)

-   [The DOM | CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/dom/). You may **ignore**
    these sections if you wish: "JavaScript can manipulate the DOM" and "Ajax
    and Templating".

-   [Try jQuery](http://try.jquery.com/). You only need to complete level 1.

-   [Check out this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1cKlKM3jYI). The
point is to get to think about the DOM as a tree! The DOM is not source and
it's also not a rendered page.

## jQuery !== ?

Please name two things the DOM is not.

```md
<!-- DOM is not HTML and DOM is not JavaScript. The DOM is the structure of the informaiton on a page. Defined as the Document Object Model, the DOM allows developers additional insight into the website their working on by offering a variety of real-time editing tools. -->
```

Is the information inside your Dev Tools the DOM? Why or why not?

```md
<!-- The information inside the Dev Tools is a visual representiton of the DOM. Technically, what was shown inside the Dev tools is created diretly from the HTML that was written. Therefore the information inside the Dev Tools is not the DOM, its the DOM's visial representation. -->
```

In your own words, why do you think the DOM is important?

```md
<!-- The DOM is important because it allows us to view and change various aspects of the HTML and javascript that makes up a certain page with different development tools. These different developer tools allows the developer several different tools to see what potential additions will do, how information is connected to each other via 'siblings', 'children', and 'parents'.
 -->
```
